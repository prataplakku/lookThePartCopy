BRANCHING STRATEGY:

**Master branch**

This is the main branch and repository with the most recent stable production code.
Direct merges into this branch should be restricted.


**Release branch**

Release branches facilitate the creation of a new production release. Once we have all of the tickets in the develop branch that should be in the next release, we should create a separate release branch with a proper version number (e.g., Release-1.0), so that the development team can continue working on next release items and freely merge them to the develop branch.


**Develop branch**

This branch will be used primarily to push ongoing development work to the Dev environment.
The DevelopÂ branch combines multiple feature branches into a single branch and deploys it.


**Feature Branches**

Developers create separate branches for each feature they work on.
Each feature branch is independent and can be developed and tested without affecting the main branch.
